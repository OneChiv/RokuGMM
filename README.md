# RokuGMM
A Siri Shortcut that will play the newest episode of Good Mythical Morning in the press of a button

This shortcut uses the Roku ECP to:
1. Launch Youtube
2. Search "gmm"
3. Select the "Good Mythical Morning" channel
4. Scroll down to "Uploads"
5. Select the latest video
6. Wait a few seconds, then select to skip ads.

Overall the process takes roughly 25-30 seconds and can be used in conjunction with automation to run at the same time as your alarm, or when your alarm is stopped.
